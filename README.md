What is the World Happiness Report?
The Sustainable Development Solutions Network publishes a World Happiness Report around March 20th of each year which is recognized by the U.N. as World Happiness Day. 
As the website states, the report itself reflects “a worldwide demand for happiness and well-being as criteria for government policy.” 
The findings from the report are meant to encourage governments to prioritize happiness as a national goal on par with economic growth or national security.
